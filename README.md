This is a simple application.

It utilizes data from the SuperHeroAPI, allowing one to gain insight on their favorite comic book characters.

Just run these commands separately, head into the main directory

```
cd ComicsUnited-main

npm install

```
Next head into the client directory, after all dependencies are install the last command will start up the application.

```
cd client 

npm install

run npm dev
```
